## Scripts

The following scripts are provided:
* [deployAndInit.ts](./scripts/deployAndInit.ts): The script used to initialize the challenge with a new set of contracts.
* [ensureEnv.ts](./scripts/ensureEnv.ts): A helper script to set up environment variables for sending transactions on the GÃ¶rli testnet.
* [exampleScript.ts](./scripts/exampleScript.ts): A sample script that sends a transaction to the BuggyEscrow contract.
* [exampleDecode.ts](./scripts/exampleDecode.ts): A sample script that decodes transaction data using the contract ABI.
